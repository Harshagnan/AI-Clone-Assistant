# AI-Clone-Assistant
The AI Clone Assistant is a smart app with chat and speech features, built using Flask (Python), React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It integrates OpenAI and Gemini APIs to deliver fast, natural, and context-aware conversations with a modern, responsive UI.

### **AI Clone Assistant â€“ Project Description**

The **AI Clone Assistant** is an intelligent, interactive assistant designed to provide both **speech** and **chat-based communication**. It integrates multiple AI models to deliver accurate, context-aware responses while offering a smooth and modern user experience.

* **Frontend**: Built with **React JS**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and optimized with **Vite** for fast performance and a responsive UI. The frontend provides a clean interface where users can interact with the assistant either by typing or through voice commands.

* **Backend**: Powered by **Flask (Python)**, the backend handles API requests, manages conversational logic, and connects the frontend with AI models.

* **APIs Integrated**:

  * **OpenAI** (for natural language understanding and generation).
  * **Gemini** (for enhanced conversational intelligence and alternative responses).

* **Core Functions**:

  * **Chat Mode**: Users can type queries and receive AI-generated responses in real time.
  * **Speech Mode**: Voice input and output allow natural, hands-free communication with the assistant.

This project combines the flexibility of **Flask and Python** with the performance and modern design of **React + Tailwind + Vite**, creating an efficient and user-friendly AI-powered assistant.
